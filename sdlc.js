// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// 1. planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisofRequirements = "This step in the process is to determine the users expectations of the product being built or worked on. Customers will have a list of features called requirements that must be designed or detailed into the product."

const Design = "The process of transforming the users requirements into some suitable form. The design process is produced using the analysis of requirements for the product."

const Implementation = "The process and procedures needed to take the software applications from the planning, design, and development stage and transform it into the production stage of a functioning product."

const TestingIntegration = "The process in which different components of a software application are tested as a combined entity."

const Maintain = "The process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs."
